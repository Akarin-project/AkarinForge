Introduction
---
> AkarinForge is a next-generation Forge server software with the Bukkit API from the 'new dimension'.

As based on [MinecraftForge](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge), it should provide high compatibility with mods. In other words, support plugins but not break mods are the main goal of the project.
