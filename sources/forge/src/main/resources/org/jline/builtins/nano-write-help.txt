Write File Help Text

 Type the name that you wish to save the current file as and press Enter to save the file.

 If you have selected text with the mark, you will be prompted to save only the selected portion to a separate file.  To reduce the chance of overwriting the current file with just a portion of it, the current filename is not the default in this mode.

 The following function keys are available in Write File mode:

^G      (F1)            Display this help text
^C                      Cancel the current function
