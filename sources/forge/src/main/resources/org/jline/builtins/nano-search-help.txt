Search Command Help Text

 Enter the words or characters you would like to search for, and then press Enter.  If there is a match for the text you entered, the screen will be updated to the location of the nearest match for the search string.

 The previous search string will be shown in brackets after the search prompt.  Hitting Enter without entering any text will perform the previous search.  If you have selected text with the mark and then search to replace, only matches in the selected text will be replaced.
